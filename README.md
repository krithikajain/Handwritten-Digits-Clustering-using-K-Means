# imageClustering

#Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm for the task of clustering handwritten digit images.
The dataset consists of 10,740 images, each represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixel values, flattened into a 1x784 vector. 
The goal is to assign each image to one of K clusters (in this case, K is set to 10 for the digits 0-9).
